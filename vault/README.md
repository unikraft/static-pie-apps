The code starts by downloading the vault from GitHub.
Next, it creates a directory to store all of the files and then starts configuring Vault.
The code first removes any existing Golang installation on your system before installing Go 1.20.2 with the command "sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go".
After that, it installs go into its default location using the command "sudo sh -c 'echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> /etc/profile'".
Finally, it builds Vault and copies over bin to make sure everything is in place for use later on.
The code attempts to build the vault binary, and then run it in a shell.
The code above does not have any error checking or other safeguards in place.

After build executable is at vault/bin/vault
